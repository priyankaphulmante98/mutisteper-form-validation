- Form is one of the most important part of any application. Handling and managing forms in React apps are hard, especially multi-step forms. There are many different libraries out there that can make your life easier and Material UI is one of the best choice nowadays.

- This is all about explaining how to build a simple multi-step form with Material-UI .
  
- For Materil UI also seamlessly integrates with Material UI (MUI) - a React library that implement Google Material Design, providing many components like TextField, Button, CheckBox, Select, Step and several others out of the box, I decided to use MUI for this project to speed up the UI development and give the app a more decent look.

- Here is a quick overview of what we are going to do:

- Create a new React app using npx create-react-app multistepper_form
- Create a simple multi-step Checkout form with  Material UI
